# Exploring_Parallel_Programming_Models_for_Matrix_Computation
To explore and implement matrix addition using various parallel programming models on a 4-core processor. The objective is to understand the concepts of sequential execution, shared memory parallelism (with synchronization), and distributed memory communication (point-to-point andd collective operations using MPI).
